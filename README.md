# Milestone-02
The final milestone for CHIP 690!

## Goals
My primary goal for this assignment was to explore drug shortage data to find valuable insights. In particular, I was curious whether the data would agree with my previous understanding of shortages, including the most common reasons for shortages, the most commonly affected drugs, and what medical fields may be affected the most. In the end, I wasn't particularly surprised to see injectables make up a large portion of shortage drugs as they tend to be the most sensitive to supply chain issues and manufacturing quality problems.

## Deliverable
The final product of this exploration is a Jupyter notebook that displays the answers to some of these questions, with equal parts tables and data visualization. Below is the URL of the dataset:

## Drawbacks
What I would have loved to have included was some visualizations of how drug shortages have changed over time. Unfortunately, the date fields in the dataset were not particularly helpful for answering this question, so I had to drop it. I think it would also be interesting to dive into the most common drugs on shortage for a handful of medical fields rather than just focusing on anesthesia, but personally I found anesthesia to be the most interesting and the most widespread (in terms of most common shortages).
